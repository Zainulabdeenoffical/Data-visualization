## Project Details

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook developed in **Google Colab** to demonstrate data visualization techniques. The project uses a CSV dataset and focuses on utilizing **Pandas** for data processing and analysis.

### Colab Notebook

The project is designed using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), making it easy to run and share the notebook without needing any local setup.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **TMDB 5000 Credits**, which provides information about various movies. Due to the large file size (more than 25 MB), the dataset is stored in a ZIP file. 

**Important:**
The dataset is available as a ZIP file because GitHub restricts the upload of files larger than 25 MB. Please extract the ZIP file before using it in the notebook.

- **Dataset File:** `tmdb_5000_credits.zip`
- **Extracted File:** `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`

Make sure to unzip the file before running the notebook.

### Tools & Libraries

- **Pandas:** For data analysis and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib:** For basic plotting and visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** For enhanced visualizations and statistical plotting.

### Instructions to Use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Extract the `tmdb_5000_credits.zip` file.
3. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook and execute each cell to visualize and analyze the dataset.
